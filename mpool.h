/*
 *  Memory Pool for fixed blocksize.
 *
 *  For many algorihtms (e.g. linked list), the memory handling is most
 *  time-consuming process. In case fixed size of blocks are constanly
 *  allocated and deallocated, the performance can be improved significantly
 *  by using private memory pools.
 *
 *  Default setup of memory pool:
 *    void * pool = MPoolInit(sizeof(your_struct_t), MPOOL_FALSE, MPOOL_TRUE);
 *
 *  This memory pool works as stand-alone library, but since this was designed
 *  specially for LList linked list (llist.h), this works perfectly with it.
 *
 *  Default setup with memory pool:
 *    llist_t * list = LInit(sizeof(your_struct_t), NULL, pool);
